## Aim: 
To build a console based Calculator
## Description/Working of code:
1. This code provides an interface for performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers entered by the user.

2. It utilizes a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for an arithmetic operation until they choose to stop.

3. The user is given a choice to select an operation by inputting the corresponding number (1-4).

4. After selecting an operation, the user is prompted to enter two numbers.

5. The code then calls the appropriate function (add, subtract, multiply, or divide) based on the user's selected operation, passing in the two entered numbers. The function calculates the result and the result is displayed to the user.

6. The program will continue to run until the user inputs "no" when asked if they want to continue their calculation.
